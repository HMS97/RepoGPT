# RepoGPT
RepoGPT is a Python library that allows you to search and answer questions about a GitHub repository's content using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. The library converts the repository into a PDF file and then indexes the content using the VectorstoreIndexCreator and FAISS. The content can then be queried and answered using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo API.
